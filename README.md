My first homework at programming II.

* Programm overview
The final program uses the following 3 static libraries:

- `commands.h`: Composed of the main functions of the program: `read`, `print`, `clear`, `sort`, `analyze`, and `free`.
- `aux_functions.h`: Composed of auxiliary functions to those in `commands.h`.
- `operations.h`: Composed of the `get_operations` function.
